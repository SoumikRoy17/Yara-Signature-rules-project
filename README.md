YARA signature rules are used to identify and classify malware or other suspicious files based on patterns of known threats. These rules provide a way to search for specific characteristics in files, such as text strings, byte sequences, or file structures, and flag them if they match.

Key Components of YARA Rules:
Rule Name: A unique identifier for the rule.
Meta Section: Contains descriptive information about the rule, like the author, description, and references.
Strings Section: Defines the text, hex patterns, or regular expressions to search for within a file.
Condition Section: Specifies the conditions under which the rule will be triggered. This could involve combinations of strings, file sizes, or other conditions.

rule ExampleRule {
    meta:
        author = "Author Name"
        description = "Detects malware XYZ"
    strings:
        $str1 = "malicious_string"
        $str2 = {A1 B2 C3 D4}
    condition:
        $str1 or $str2
}
